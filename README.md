# Developer Excercise
The purpose of this excercise is to give you and us an idea of what its like working through a problem with you. We like to work collaboratively, so this is really just another way to get to know you.

## Instructions
In this exercise there is a base Java Spring Boot project and a data file titled Course-Data.csv. We would like for you to create a database, populate it with the data in the csv file and then create an API endpoint to return course data in json format. The endpoint should accept two parameters, course code prefix and course code number, both being optional.
