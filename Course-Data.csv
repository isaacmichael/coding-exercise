EDU373	Y	This course will address the progression of number sense concepts from Kindergarten through Grade 8 as they relate to and support instruction in elementary and middle school settings.  Emphasis will be on deepening teacher candidates� understanding of arithmetic operations, teaching concepts vs. procedures, and incorporating the Standards for Mathematical Practice.    In this course, number sense is defined as an intuitive understanding of numbers, their magnitudes, their relationships and how they are affected by operations. An appreciation of number sense makes numerical activities in curriculum as well as in the real world meaningful.    According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V), a specific learning disability in mathematics is manifested as difficulties with number sense, memorization of arithmetic facts, accurate or fluent calculation, and/or accurate math reasoning.    This course will enable you to understand the root causes of the difficulties exhibited by students with math learning disabilities and how it affects their performance in elementary, middle, and high school mathematics. We will examine case studies to determine how number sense permeates student work in the areas of numerical operations, geometry, rational numbers, and algebra, as well as determine research-based strategies to repair number sense deficits. Teacher candidates will apply number sense concepts to their teaching practice by designing and implementing six number sense activities with an assigned student (focusing on one grade level).
